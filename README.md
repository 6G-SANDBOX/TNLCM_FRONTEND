# React Project with Node.js v22.12.0

This is a project developed with React and Node.js v22.12.0. The project includes a client-side application built with React for the frontend and a backend server using Node.js.

## Prerequisites

To run this project on your local machine, you need to have the following programs installed:

- [Node.js v22.12.0](https://nodejs.org/) (It is recommended to use this specific version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Included with Node.js)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies for both the client and the server.

3. **Configure the environment (optional):**

   If you need to configure specific environment variables, you can create a `.env` file at the root of the project and define the necessary variables.

4. **Start the server and client:**

   To run the server and the client application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run both the Node.js server and the React application simultaneously.

   - The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you have configured).
   - The React frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Open in your browser:**

   Once everything is up and running, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Available Scripts

Here are some of the scripts you can use:

- `npm start`: Starts the server and the client.
- `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build of the React application.
- `npm test`: Runs the project tests (if configured).
- `npm run lint`: Checks the code quality using linters.
